These students often feel neglected as their personal issues aren’t deemed to be “of utmost importance”. 
For a lot of the other issues, schools tend to avoid addressing them on grounds of them being “controversial”. They dissuade students from voicing their opinion out of fear that the topic is too “sensitive” and creates unnecessary “buzz”.",It will definitely make a difference,"It’ll be wonderful if the education system can revamp it’s approach towards teaching students.
