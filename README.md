### Inclusivity in the Digital Humanities - Group Project Abstract
My group worked on bias and inclusivity in the Digital Humanities. My partner and I primarily looked at the need for inclusivity of voices other than the straight, white, male majority and also the need for a larger emphasis on "Arts" leading to a more humanistic approach to Data Science and Digital Humanities. Elliot Eisner's concept of the brain (biology) v mind (culture) made a compelling argument for the relevance or art and the ability to convert personalised process of "recall" to hold social value by using it in conjunction with imagination. A concept very essential to this discussion was that of "erasure" wherein the experiences of the minorities, predominantly feminists and black authorship experiences are *erased* by virtue of exclusion. This is often a self-perpetuating cycle. There is an urgent need to include and amplify these voices in the Digital Humanities realm, especially if we desire a more comprehensive view of what the humanities and 'being human' is meant to be. We end with some critical questions about Big Data and importance of questioning assumptions that are often disguised as fact -- primarily the idea of algorithm bias and that 'numbers don't lie'. In offering tangible solutions to how we believed that we can promote such inclusivity in our daily lives, the concept of a "diversity bonus", which is a concept that diversity in teams actually leads to measurable productive value-adds, was interesting to me. This is the easiest collaboration process that I've had the pleasure of engaging in. My partner and my work ethics lined up very well and we stayed ahead of deadlines. I think was helped was that we split the work between us, engaged in prolonged conversations on organisational structure and, the most important, we took the time to get to know each other as people and friends - not just a 'project partner'. She definitely added many positive elements to my session of Digitial Humanities 100  

### Youth Perception of Sexual Education in India - Individual Project Abstract  
This individual project investigated the youth perception of sexual education and other related taboo topics in India, using data from a survey that I conducted in May 2020. It aimed to showcase the discontent, dissatisfaction and information gap that existed between what the youth want to know about sexual education and what is actually being taught to them. I believed that there was a need to start addressing sex as more than just a biological phenomenon. To this effect, I used matplotlib, seaborn, gensim, scikit and pandas library in Python to analyse demographic distribution of participants and encode the rated responses of the participants regarding measures of importance of topics, sexual policing experiences and frequency of addressal in schooling systems. I also employed Topic Modeling (LDA and Word2Vec) along with pyLDAvis visualisations to extract topics from the free responses of participants on how the corpus of taboo topics was dealt with in educational institutions. The reuslts matched my hypothesis in that a large proportion of felt that the topics were never addressed in school but at the same time they ranked them high in importance. This indicated the information gap and need for curricular change policies. Four main topics were extracted which indicate that sex education and the taboo topics were treated in a hostile manner, taught and not discussed with the students. Dialogue on gender identity and mental health were rare and sex was indeed likely to be treated as biological phenomenon. I think that the survey should be interpreted by centering it on the Perceptual results and use the demographic and textual analysis results as supplementary data to add evidence and credibility to the results from the Perceptual section. While preliminary, conducting more such surveys using a more representative sample would be the best move forward.
